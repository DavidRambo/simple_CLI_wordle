#+title: Simple Wordle for Terminal

Play wordle on the command line.

The dictionary is derived from the Scrabble Dictionary: https://sourceforge.net/projects/scrabbledict/files/Scrabble%20Dictionary/0.91/

To run:
~python3 wordle.py~


### TODO
I don't have immediate plans to update this version, as I think it would need a persistent display to accomplish more features.
For one, it does not show eliminated letters.
Listing them after each guess would work, but it would be messy.
Painting the entire screen could work, but I would rather use a GUI library than remain in the command line.
